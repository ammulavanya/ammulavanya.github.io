### What Students Say

> "Discussion were extremely helpful (going over lecture material, having discussion notes and handouts) - Lavanya explained all concepts thoroughly - always available to
ask for help (emails, office hours, discussion sections) - very kind and understanding - extremely patient with students - best GWU TA"  
>  
> "I really enjoyed having Ammu Lavanya as my TA. Discussion section really enhanced my knowledge of the course concepts."  
>  
> "TA Lavanya knows her stuff, can explain the complexities of Macro very well, and above all is very approachable as far as TA's go. Also she has a stupid fast turn around
on midterm grading which is very nice especially given that the second midterm happens with two weeks before the final. Also the notes and practice problems from
discussion are very useful for checking your understanding of the class material"

> "I believe that the discussion sections were some of the most informative times of the class because they helped condense large amounts of content. I also believe it was
taught in a very fair style where those who engaged with the material would come out better."
