Welcome!  

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at The George Washington University. 
My research interests lie in the field of International Finance, Monetary Economics, Empirical Banking and Financial History.

**I am on the 2025-26 job market.**

In 2025, I worked as a Research Officer at the International Monetary Fund. I also participated in the Fund Internship Program in the summer of 2024.
Before graduate school, I worked at the Reserve Bank of India. 

I received an M.A. in Applied Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University and a B.A. (Honours) in Economics from the University of Delhi.
